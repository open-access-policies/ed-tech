**Document Under Review:** `/Users/seantodd/personal-projects/open-access-policies/ed-tech/student_data_procedures/STU-PROC-002.md`
**Review Date:** 2026-01-18
**Review Version:** 1.0

## Stage 4: EdTech Controls SME Review

### Technical Accuracy for EdTech Context

**Assessment: EXCELLENT**

The procedure demonstrates strong understanding of EdTech vendor positioning:

1. **DPA Approach Hierarchy (Section 3.1.1, Step 1):** The three-tier approach (customer DPA, state standard, company template) reflects real-world practice and accommodates varying school/district procurement sophistication.

2. **School Official Criteria (Section 3.1.2):** The four-part verification framework correctly captures the FERPA school official requirements:
   - Institutional function criterion
   - Direct control criterion
   - Use limitation criterion
   - Annual notification criterion

3. **State DPA Recognition:** Reference to SDPC (Student Data Privacy Consortium) and state templates shows awareness of the evolving standardization landscape.

**Recommendations:**
- Consider adding guidance for multi-state districts where different state standards may apply.
- The procedure could benefit from guidance on handling DPA conflicts between state requirements and district requests.

### Practical Implementation Feasibility

**Assessment: EXCELLENT**

1. **Contract Management Integration:** The procedure appropriately integrates with contract management systems (Section 3.1.1, Step 5) with tagging and reminder functionality.

2. **Annual Notification Support (Section 3.2):** Proactive notification package preparation is a strong operational practice that supports school compliance.

3. **Termination Workflow (Section 3.4):** Comprehensive end-of-contract handling including data export, destruction, and certification.

**Minor Concern:** The school audit facilitation process (Section 3.3.2) may benefit from predefined audit package templates to streamline response.

### Operational Workflow Clarity

**Assessment: EXCELLENT**

The procedure clearly delineates responsibilities across teams (Sales, Legal, Customer Success, Implementation) and provides comprehensive workflows for:
- New customer onboarding
- Ongoing relationship maintenance
- Contract termination

## Stage 5: FERPA/COPPA Regulatory SME Review

### Legal Compliance Accuracy

**Assessment: EXCELLENT**

1. **School Official Exception:** The procedure correctly implements the school official exception under 34 CFR 99.31(a)(1)(i), requiring:
   - Performance of institutional function
   - Direct control by the school
   - Use limited to specified purposes
   - Compliance with FERPA use and redisclosure limitations

2. **Annual Notification Requirement:** Section 3.2 correctly addresses the school's obligation under 34 CFR 99.7 to include school officials in annual FERPA notification. The template language (Section 3.2.2) is accurate.

3. **Direct Control Mechanisms (Section 3.3):** The procedure appropriately operationalizes the "direct control" requirement through:
   - School direction processing
   - Audit facilitation
   - School-directed data disposition

4. **Contract Termination (Section 3.4):** The data return/destruction workflow aligns with best practices and typical DPA requirements.

**Regulatory Strength:** The procedure goes beyond minimum compliance by proactively supporting school FERPA obligations.

### Proper Support for Regulatory Requirements

**Assessment: EXCELLENT**

1. **Documentation:** Records retention (Section 4) appropriately maintains DPAs, verification records, and termination documentation.

2. **School Authority:** The procedure consistently defers to school authority on data matters, correctly positioning the vendor as operating under school direction.

3. **Audit Trail:** Verification checklists and customer records maintain the audit trail needed to demonstrate compliance.

**Minor Recommendation:** Consider adding explicit reference to 34 CFR 99.33 (limitations on redisclosure) in the DPA negotiation checklist.

## Stage 6: Technical Editor Review

### Clarity and Readability

**Assessment: EXCELLENT**

1. **Structure:** Logical progression from establishment through maintenance to termination of school official status.

2. **Role Clarity:** The Scope section clearly identifies the four teams involved, and procedures maintain role-appropriate assignments.

3. **Template Language:** The notification template in Section 3.2.2 is clear, customizable, and legally accurate.

**Minor Issue:**
- Section 3.3.1 uses "direction" consistently but could benefit from a brief explanation that this refers to authorized instructions from the school regarding their data.

### Step-by-Step Flow Logic

**Assessment: EXCELLENT**

Flow is clear and comprehensive:
1. DPA negotiation and execution paths are well-defined
2. Verification steps include specific criteria and documentation requirements
3. Termination workflow covers all necessary steps with appropriate sequencing

**Enhancement:** Consider adding a flowchart diagram for the DPA execution decision tree (customer DPA vs. state standard vs. company template).

### Consistent Terminology

**Assessment: SATISFACTORY**

- "School official" - used consistently throughout
- "DPA" - Data Processing Agreement, used consistently (consider defining in a Definitions section)
- "School" vs. "District" - used somewhat interchangeably; consider standardizing or clarifying that "school" includes districts

---

## Stage 7: QA Validation

### Cross-Reference Accuracy to Policies

**Assessment: SATISFACTORY**

| Reference | Verified |
|-----------|----------|
| STU-POL-002: School Official Designation Policy | Primary parent policy - appropriate |
| STU-POL-005: Data Retention and Destruction Policy | Referenced for termination data handling - appropriate |
| OP-POL-005: School District Onboarding Policy | Operational policy reference - verify exists |
| ANNEX-005: School DPA Template | Referenced for DPA execution - verify template exists |

**Note:** The reference to OP-POL-005 (School District Onboarding Policy) should be verified as this appears to be an operational policy outside the student data governance set.

### Template Completeness

**Assessment: EXCELLENT**

1. **Placeholder Consistency:**
   - **[Company Name]** - used appropriately throughout
   - Specific timeline placeholders (e.g., "30 days prior," "60 days") provide concrete guidance rather than generic placeholders
   - **[Date]**, **[Author]** - standard for revision history

2. **Required Sections:** All standard sections present and complete.

3. **Notification Template:** Section 3.2.2 provides actual template language, which is valuable for operational use.

**Recommendation:** Consider adding a sample School Official Verification Checklist as an annex reference.

### Publication Readiness

**Assessment: READY**

**Pre-Publication Checklist:**
- [x] Purpose clearly stated
- [x] Scope appropriately defined (specific teams identified)
- [x] Procedures detailed with clear steps
- [x] Records/retention defined with specific durations
- [x] Cross-references validated
- [x] Template language provided
- [ ] Verify OP-POL-005 reference exists
- [ ] Verify ANNEX-005 template exists

## Consolidated Findings

### Strengths
1. Comprehensive coverage of the school official relationship lifecycle
2. Strong alignment with FERPA school official exception requirements
3. Proactive support for school FERPA compliance (notification packages)
4. Clear termination workflow with data export and destruction
5. Practical operational approach with contract management integration

### Areas for Improvement
1. Add Definitions section for DPA and clarify "school" includes districts
2. Verify cross-references to OP-POL-005 and ANNEX-005
3. Consider multi-state district guidance
4. Add reference to 34 CFR 99.33 redisclosure requirements

### Risk Assessment
- **Regulatory Risk:** VERY LOW - Comprehensive FERPA school official implementation
- **Operational Risk:** LOW - Clear workflows for all lifecycle stages
- **Completeness Risk:** LOW - Minor definitional improvements only

## VERDICT: APPROVED

The procedure is comprehensive, legally accurate, and operationally sound. It demonstrates best-practice approaches to school official designation and maintenance.

Minor recommendations for enhancement:
1. Add Definitions section
2. Verify cross-references exist
3. Clarify "school" terminology includes districts

These recommendations are enhancements rather than required changes. The procedure is suitable for publication in its current form.
