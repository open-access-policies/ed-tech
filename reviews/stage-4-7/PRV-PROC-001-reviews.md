# PRV-PROC-001: FERPA Compliance Procedure - Expert Reviews

**Document Under Review:** `/Users/seantodd/personal-projects/open-access-policies/ed-tech/privacy_procedures/PRV-PROC-001.md`
**Review Date:** 2026-01-18
**Review Stages:** 4-7 (EdTech Controls SME, FERPA/COPPA Regulatory SME, Technical Editor, QA Validation)

---

## Stage 4: EdTech Controls SME Review

### Technical Accuracy for EdTech Context

**Strengths:**
- Correctly identifies the four criteria for school official designation (Section 3.2.1), which is essential for EdTech vendors operating under FERPA
- Accurately addresses the directory information opt-out verification requirement (Section 3.1.2)
- Proper treatment of education records identification with appropriate exclusions table
- Disclosure evaluation basis table (Section 3.3.1) covers all common EdTech scenarios

**Concerns:**
- Section 3.1.1 Step 2: The exclusions list is accurate but could benefit from clarifying that "alumni records" only applies to records created after the student leaves, not historical records that continue to be maintained
- No mention of de-identified or aggregate data handling, which is increasingly common in EdTech analytics

### Practical Implementation Feasibility

**Strengths:**
- Clear "When" triggers for each procedure section make implementation straightforward
- Escalation criteria are specific and actionable (Section 4)
- Records retention table provides clear guidance with specific timeframes

**Concerns:**
- Section 3.5.1 references a "[Number, e.g., 5] business days" placeholder for access request compilation - this needs a defined value
- The procedure assumes a single "data inventory" system exists but does not specify integration requirements
- Section 3.4.1 references "except routine school disclosures" without clearly defining what constitutes "routine"

### Operational Workflow Clarity

**Strengths:**
- Step-by-step format with numbered actions is clear and auditable
- Tables effectively summarize complex requirements (disclosure bases, exclusions)
- Cross-references to related procedures are helpful

**Concerns:**
- The annual review process (Section 3.6) could benefit from a more explicit checklist or workflow diagram
- No guidance on handling multi-district or consortium arrangements common in EdTech

**SME Recommendation:** APPROVED WITH MINOR CHANGES
- Fill in placeholder values
- Add guidance for aggregate/de-identified data
- Clarify "routine school disclosures"

## Stage 5: FERPA/COPPA Regulatory SME Review

### Legal Compliance Accuracy

**Strengths:**
- Correctly cites 34 CFR Part 99 as the governing regulation
- School official criteria align with 34 CFR 99.31(a)(1)(i)(B) requirements
- Disclosure exception categories match FERPA permitted disclosures
- Record-keeping requirements align with 34 CFR 99.32 obligations
- 45-day timeline reference for access requests is correct per 34 CFR 99.10

**Concerns:**
- Section 3.3.2 Step 4 references "subcontractor agreement includes required terms" but does not specify what those required terms are under FERPA
- The studies exception reference (34 CFR 99.31(a)(6)) in Section 3.3.1 is correct but lacks procedural detail on implementing the requirements
- No mention of the 2011 FERPA regulations amendments regarding data redisclosure restrictions

### Proper Support for Regulatory Requirements

**Parent/Eligible Student Rights:**
- Access rights support (Section 3.5.1) correctly positions company as supporting school compliance
- Amendment request handling appropriately defers to school direction
- Complaint handling process is appropriate for vendor role

**School Official Designation:**
- Four criteria verification is comprehensive and accurate
- Annual verification requirement properly addressed
- DPA terms review appropriately covers required elements

**Disclosure Management:**
- Disclosure log requirements are compliant
- Minimum necessary principle correctly applied
- Legal process handling includes appropriate Legal involvement

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Record retention periods are reasonable and defensible
- Audit accessibility requirement is appropriate

**Regulatory Recommendations:**
- Add explicit reference to prohibition on redisclosure by recipients
- Expand studies exception implementation detail
- Specify subcontractor FERPA flow-down requirements

**Regulatory SME Recommendation:** APPROVED WITH MINOR CHANGES
- No critical compliance gaps identified
- Minor enhancements would strengthen regulatory defensibility

## Stage 6: Technical Editor Review

### Clarity and Readability

**Strengths:**
- Purpose statement is clear and appropriately scoped
- Consistent use of "When:" triggers before each procedure section
- Tables break up dense regulatory content effectively
- Active voice used consistently ("Evaluate," "Verify," "Document")

**Concerns:**
- Section 3.2.1 Step 2 table header "Verification" is vague - consider "How to Verify"
- Some steps are compound when they should be atomic (e.g., Section 3.3.1 Step 2 has multiple verification items)
- Inconsistent use of em-dashes vs. regular dashes

### Step-by-Step Flow Logic

**Strengths:**
- Logical progression from identification to handling to documentation
- Each section builds on previous sections appropriately
- Escalation paths are clearly defined at the end

**Concerns:**
- Section 3.1.1 jumps from "Evaluate" to "Check exclusions" to "Classify" but the decision tree between steps 2 and 3 could be clearer
- Section 3.5.1 has three parallel paths (access, amendment, complaints) that could be broken into separate sub-sections for clarity

### Consistent Terminology

**Findings:**
- "Education records" used consistently (correct)
- "School official" terminology is consistent with FERPA language
- "DPA" abbreviation introduced without initial definition in Section 3.2.1
- "Workforce members" used in scope - consistent with policy framework
- "[Company Name]" placeholder used consistently

**Terminology Recommendations:**
- Define "DPA" on first use (Data Processing Agreement or Data Privacy Agreement)
- Consider adding a definitions section or glossary reference

### Editorial Recommendations

1. Add DPA definition on first use
2. Break compound steps into atomic actions
3. Clarify decision logic between identification and classification steps
4. Standardize dash usage throughout

**Technical Editor Recommendation:** APPROVED WITH MINOR CHANGES

## Stage 7: QA Validation

### Cross-Reference Accuracy to Policies

| Reference | Target Document | Verified |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| PRV-POL-001 | FERPA Compliance Policy | To be verified at publication |
| STU-POL-002 | School Official Designation Policy | To be verified at publication |
| STU-PROC-003 | Parent Rights Request Procedure | To be verified at publication |
| 34 CFR Part 99 | FERPA regulations | Valid external reference |

**Cross-Reference Notes:**
- Internal references use consistent naming convention

### Template Completeness

| Placeholder | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| [Company Name] | Placeholder | Used consistently throughout |
| [Number, e.g., 5] | Placeholder | Section 3.5.1 - needs default or guidance |

## Consolidated Review Summary

### Findings by Severity

**Critical Issues:** None identified

**Major Issues:** None identified

**Minor Issues:**
1. Placeholder values need completion (all reviewers)
2. DPA abbreviation needs definition (Technical Editor)
3. "Routine school disclosures" needs clarification (EdTech SME)
4. Subcontractor FERPA terms need specification (Regulatory SME)
5. Aggregate/de-identified data handling missing (EdTech SME)

### Recommended Actions

| Action | Owner | Priority |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Complete all placeholder values | Document Owner | High |
| Add DPA definition | Document Owner | Medium |
| Clarify routine disclosure definition | Legal/Compliance | Medium |
| Add aggregate data handling guidance | Privacy Team | Low |
| Specify subcontractor flow-down terms | Legal | Low |

## FINAL VERDICT: APPROVED WITH MINOR CHANGES

The FERPA Compliance Procedure is well-structured, legally accurate, and operationally sound. The procedure correctly implements FERPA requirements for EdTech vendors and provides clear guidance for workforce members. Minor enhancements around definitions, placeholder completion, and edge case handling will strengthen the document before final publication.
