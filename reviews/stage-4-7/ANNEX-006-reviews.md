## Stage 4: EdTech Controls SME Review

**Reviewer Persona:** EdTech Industry Controls Specialist with 10+ years experience implementing privacy controls in K-12 technology platforms.

### Technical Accuracy for EdTech Context

**Strengths:**
- Plain language approach appropriate for parent audiences (avoids legal jargon)
- "What We Don't Do" section provides clear, actionable information for concerned parents
- State-specific sections (New York, California) address common requirements

**Areas for Consideration:**
- Consider adding a section on data portability (parents may want to know if they can get copies of their child's data)
- Add information about what happens when a student changes schools or grades up
- Include guidance on how parents can identify if their child's school uses the company's products
- Consider adding FAQ format for common parent questions

### Practical Usability of Templates/Checklists

**Strengths:**
- Modular state-specific sections can be included or excluded as appropriate
- Contact information section provides clear escalation path
- Optional acknowledgment form useful for documentation purposes

**Areas for Consideration:**
- Add estimated response times for each type of request
- Consider providing the notice in multiple languages or noting translation availability
- Add visual elements suggestions (icons, headers) for school customization
- Provide guidance on distribution methods (email, handbook, website posting)

### Completeness of Coverage

**Strengths:**
- Covers core FERPA rights (access, amendment, deletion)
- Addresses COPPA school consent model
- Includes both New York and California state-specific provisions

**Gaps Identified:**
- Missing state-specific sections for other major states (Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois)
- No mention of special education/disability data protections
- Missing information about data breach notification (what parents can expect if breach occurs)
- No coverage of opt-out rights for directory information
- Consider adding section on how data is protected during remote learning

**Stage 4 Assessment:** SATISFACTORY - Consider adding more state-specific sections and breach notification information

## Stage 5: FERPA/COPPA Regulatory SME Review

**Reviewer Persona:** Education Privacy Attorney with expertise in FERPA, COPPA, and state student privacy laws.

### Legal Compliance Accuracy

**Strengths:**
- Correctly describes COPPA school consent model and its requirements
- FERPA rights (inspection, amendment) accurately described
- "Schools Act on Your Behalf" section appropriately explains COPPA's school consent provision

**Areas Requiring Attention:**
- Under FERPA, parents have 45 days to receive access, not an unspecified timeline; consider adding this timeframe
- The "Request Deletion" right needs clarification - under FERPA, deletion is limited; schools/districts determine what must be maintained
- Should clarify that COPPA deletion rights are stronger than FERPA deletion rights for under-13 data
- New York section should reference specific rights under Ed Law 2-d more explicitly
- California section should note deletion right is enforceable against the operator

### Citation Correctness

**Observations:**
- Document appropriately avoids legal citations for parent-facing content
- Reference links to studentprivacy.ed.gov and ftc.gov/coppa are appropriate
- New York Education Law 2-d correctly identified
- California SOPIPA correctly identified

**Recommendations:**
- Consider adding reference to state department of education complaint processes
- New York section should note Chief Privacy Officer complaint option more prominently

### Regulatory Mapping Completeness

**Complete:**
- Core FERPA parent rights covered
- COPPA notice requirements addressed
- Key state law provisions (NY, CA) included

**Incomplete:**
- Missing PPRA notice requirements if assessment tools collect protected information
- No mention of IDEA/Section 504 rights for students with disabilities
- Should add reference to FERPA complaint process (SPPO complaint option)
- Consider adding Colorado, Connecticut, and Illinois state sections given EdTech market presence

**Stage 5 Assessment:** APPROVED WITH MINOR CHANGES - Deletion rights clarification and additional state sections recommended

## Stage 6: Technical Editor Review

**Reviewer Persona:** Technical Documentation Editor with expertise in policy and compliance documentation.

### Clarity and Readability

**Strengths:**
- Excellent plain language usage appropriate for parent audience
- Checkmarks and X marks provide clear visual communication
- Headers are descriptive and scannable
- Appropriate reading level (estimated 8th grade)

**Areas for Improvement:**
- "Eligible student" terminology (FERPA term for students 18+) not explained; add brief note or avoid term
- "Schools Act on Your Behalf" heading may be confusing; consider "How Schools Consent for You"
- Contact section uses "[School/District Name]" but schools will customize - add note that this is a template
- Acknowledgment form "I have questions" checkbox could be clearer about expected follow-up

### Format and Structure

**Strengths:**
- Logical flow from what is collected to how it's used to rights
- State-specific sections clearly marked for conditional inclusion
- Document Information table appropriately minimal for template

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Consider adding a "Quick Facts" summary box at the top
- More Information section links could be formatted as a cleaner list
- State-specific sections use italics for conditional instruction; ensure this is preserved in final formatting
- Consider numbered sections for easier reference in parent communications

### Consistent Terminology

**Terminology Audit:**
- "Your child" vs "student" vs "child" - mostly consistent with "your child" for parent audience
- "[Company Name]" placeholder used consistently
- "Personal information" used consistently (appropriate for COPPA context)
- "Educational records" should be "education records" per FERPA terminology
- "Information" vs "data" - document uses "information" which is appropriate for parent audience

**Stage 6 Assessment:** APPROVED WITH MINOR CHANGES - Minor terminology corrections and formatting improvements recommended

**Cross-Reference Issues:**
- No reference to ANNEX-005 (School DPA Template) which governs the data relationship
- No reference to company's public-facing Privacy Policy (should be created if not existing)
- External URLs should be verified as current and stable

### Template Usability

**Testing Observations:**
