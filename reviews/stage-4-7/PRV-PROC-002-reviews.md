**Document Under Review:** `/Users/seantodd/personal-projects/open-access-policies/ed-tech/privacy_procedures/PRV-PROC-002.md`
**Review Date:** 2026-01-18
**Review Stages:** 4-7 (EdTech Controls SME, FERPA/COPPA Regulatory SME, Technical Editor, QA Validation)

---

## Stage 4: EdTech Controls SME Review

### Technical Accuracy for EdTech Context

**Strengths:**
- Correctly addresses the school consent model (Section 3.2), which is the primary consent mechanism for K-12 EdTech
- Comprehensive list of factors for "directed to children" determination (Section 3.1.1) relevant to EdTech products
- Prohibition on behavioral advertising (Section 3.5.2) aligns with EdTech best practices
- Third-party service provider requirements (Section 3.7) reflect real vendor management needs

**Concerns:**
- Section 3.2.1 Step 3 states "Executed DPA constitutes consent" - this is generally true but should note that the DPA must specifically authorize collection for COPPA purposes
- No mention of internal use operators vs. commercial operators distinction, which affects some EdTech arrangements
- Limited guidance on persistent identifiers and what constitutes "personal information" under COPPA in modern EdTech (e.g., learning analytics identifiers)

### Practical Implementation Feasibility

**Strengths:**
- Verifiable consent method table (Section 3.3.1) provides practical options appropriate for different scenarios
- School consent workflow is straightforward and reflects actual EdTech sales processes
- Parent rights procedures (Section 3.6) have clear timelines and verification requirements

**Concerns:**
- Section 3.3.1 consent methods table includes "Video conference" which may be impractical at scale for EdTech companies
- "Email-plus" method for "low-risk internal" use needs clarification on what qualifies as low-risk
- No guidance on maintaining consent records across school year transitions or student transfers

### Operational Workflow Clarity

**Strengths:**
- Clear "When" triggers make it easy to identify applicable procedures
- Parent identity verification options are practical and implementable
- Escalation to Student Data Privacy Officer is appropriate

**Concerns:**
- Section 3.4.2 privacy policy requirements should reference how to handle multiple products with different data practices
- No workflow for handling mixed-age environments (K-12 products with both under-13 and 13+ users)
- Direct parental consent renewal process (Section 3.3.2) lacks specificity on "material change" definition

**SME Recommendation:** APPROVED WITH MINOR CHANGES
- Clarify DPA-based consent requirements
- Add mixed-age environment guidance
- Define "material change" for consent renewal

---

## Stage 5: FERPA/COPPA Regulatory SME Review

### Legal Compliance Accuracy

**Strengths:**
- Correctly references 16 CFR Part 312 (COPPA Rule)
- School consent model accurately reflects FTC guidance allowing schools to consent on behalf of parents for educational purposes
- "Directed to children" factors align with 16 CFR 312.2 definition
- Data collection limitation principles match COPPA's prohibition on collecting more information than reasonably necessary
- Verifiable parental consent methods align with 16 CFR 312.5(b) approved methods

**Concerns:**
- Section 3.2.1 Step 2 mentions "No commercial use unrelated to education" - should explicitly reference that this is the FTC's condition for school consent
- The "Email-plus" consent method (Section 3.3.1) has specific requirements under COPPA (email to parent, delay, confirmation email) that should be spelled out
- Section 3.5.1 prohibits "no targeting based on online activity" but COPPA allows contextual advertising - the distinction should be clearer
- No mention of the 2013 COPPA Rule amendments regarding persistent identifiers and mobile device identifiers

### Proper Support for Regulatory Requirements

**Parental Rights:**
- Review request procedure (Section 3.6.1) correctly requires identity verification and prohibits charging fees
- Deletion request procedure (Section 3.6.2) appropriately addresses service termination implications
- Opt-out procedure (Section 3.6.3) correctly separates opt-out from deletion

**Notice Requirements:**
- Direct notice requirements (Section 3.4.1) cover required elements
- Privacy policy requirements (Section 3.4.2) align with COPPA mandates
- Operator contact information requirement correctly specified

**Data Minimization:**
- Section 3.5.1 properly addresses necessity analysis
- Prohibition on conditioning participation on excess collection is correct COPPA principle

**Third-Party Obligations:**
- Section 3.7.1 correctly requires contractual restrictions on independent use
- Monitoring requirement aligns with operator responsibility to maintain reasonable procedures

**Regulatory Recommendations:**
- Expand email-plus consent method requirements
- Clarify behavioral vs. contextual advertising distinction
- Add reference to persistent identifier personal information categories
- Specify FTC's basis for school consent model

**Regulatory SME Recommendation:** APPROVED WITH MINOR CHANGES
- Core COPPA requirements properly addressed
- Minor clarifications would improve regulatory completeness

## Stage 6: Technical Editor Review

### Clarity and Readability

**Strengths:**
- Clear, direct language throughout
- Effective use of tables for consent methods and data types
- Consistent section structure across all procedures
- Active voice maintained consistently

**Concerns:**
- Section 3.3.1 table "Implementation" column has some vague entries (e.g., "Third-party verification service" without more detail)
- "COPPA applies" determination in Section 3.1.1 could be presented as a decision flowchart
- Some paragraphs in Section 3.2.1 could be broken into additional numbered steps for clearer execution

### Step-by-Step Flow Logic

**Strengths:**
- Logical progression from applicability determination through consent to ongoing compliance
- Clear branching between school consent (Section 3.2) and direct parental consent (Section 3.3)
- Parent rights procedures follow natural request lifecycle

**Concerns:**
- Section 3.2.1 Step 4 "Verify school authority" should come earlier in the process (before providing notice)
- Section 3.3.2 "Renewing Consent" lacks a clear trigger for when to evaluate whether changes are "material"
- Transition from Section 3.3.1 Step 5 "Enable service" to ongoing compliance (Section 3.5+) is not explicitly linked

### Consistent Terminology

**Findings:**
- "Personal information" used consistently with COPPA meaning
- "Verifiable parental consent" terminology matches COPPA language
- "Operator" term from COPPA not explicitly used/defined
- "Service provider" vs. "third-party" usage is consistent within document
- "Student Data Privacy Officer" used in escalation (should verify this title exists in organization)

**Terminology Recommendations:**
- Define "operator" as used in COPPA context
- Clarify relationship between "school consent" and "verifiable parental consent" (school consent is a form of VPC)
- Consider adding a brief terminology note or cross-reference to definitions

### Editorial Recommendations

1. Reorder Section 3.2.1 Step 4 to come before Step 2
2. Add decision criteria for "material change" determination
3. Explicitly link consent procedures to ongoing compliance sections
4. Define COPPA-specific terms on first use or via reference

**Technical Editor Recommendation:** APPROVED WITH MINOR CHANGES

## FINAL VERDICT: APPROVED WITH MINOR CHANGES

The COPPA Compliance Procedure is comprehensive and addresses the key requirements for EdTech companies collecting information from children under 13. The dual pathway for school consent and direct parental consent is well-structured. The procedure correctly implements FTC COPPA Rule requirements with appropriate detail for operational execution. Minor enhancements to consent method details, advertising distinctions, and step ordering will improve clarity and regulatory defensibility.

**Reviewers:**
- EdTech Controls SME: Approved with Minor Changes
- FERPA/COPPA Regulatory SME: Approved with Minor Changes
- Technical Editor: Approved with Minor Changes
- QA Validation: Approved with Minor Changes
